    "# AI-Powered Health Analysis App\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is designed to provide personalized health insights using AI-powered calculations. It helps users analyze their health metrics such as BMI (Body Mass Index), BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), and TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) based on their input data. The app also offers tailored advice and tips to improve overall health and fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **BMI Calculation**: Determines your BMI and provides an analysis of your weight category (e.g., underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese) along with actionable advice.\n",
    "- **BMR Calculation**: Calculates your Basal Metabolic Rate, which is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest.\n",
    "- **TDEE Calculation**: Estimates your Total Daily Energy Expenditure based on your activity level, helping you understand your daily calorie needs.\n",
    "- **Personalized Health Tips**: Offers specific recommendations to improve your diet, fitness, and overall lifestyle.\n",
    "- **Interactive User Interface**: Allows users to input their weight, height, age, gender, and activity level for a customized analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works:\n",
    "1. Enter your weight, height, age, and gender.\n",
    "2. Select your activity level from the provided options.\n",
    "3. Click the \"Analyze\" button to view your health metrics and receive personalized advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Project:\n",
    "This app is built using **Streamlit**, a Python-based framework for creating interactive web applications. It aims to empower users with actionable health insights to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and well-being.\n"
